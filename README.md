# Tower of Hanoi



A Python-based project that simulates the classic mathematical puzzle known as the "Tower of Hanoi." The Tower of Hanoi puzzle involves moving a stack of disks from one peg to another, with the constraint that smaller disks must always be on top of larger ones. It's a fun and challenging problem that is often used to teach recursion and problem-solving skills.

## Description
The Tower of Hanoi is a classic puzzle that has been popular for centuries. It consists of three pegs and a set of disks with different sizes. The objective is to move all the disks from one peg to another while following these rules:
1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
2. A larger disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller disk.

This project provides a Java-based simulation of the Tower of Hanoi puzzle, allowing users to interact with the puzzle, visualize the movements, and understand the underlying recursive algorithm.

## Features
- **Interactive Simulation**: The project offers an interactive interface for users to experiment with the Tower of Hanoi puzzle, move disks, and solve it step by step.

- **Recursive Solution**: The project implements the Tower of Hanoi puzzle using a recursive algorithm, helping users understand and appreciate recursive problem-solving.

- **Customizable**: Users can customize the number of disks and pegs, providing flexibility to explore variations of the puzzle.

- **Step-by-Step Visualization**: The project provides a clear visualization of each step in solving the puzzle, making it a valuable educational tool.
